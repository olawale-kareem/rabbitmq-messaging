Rabbitmq:
    This is a message broker that implements different protocols. One of the protocol is AMQP(advance message queuing protocol) 
    AMQP was design to exchange messsage using producer, boker and a consumer. This
    producer: produces messages 
    cosumer: consumes messages 
    broker: The medium of excahnge between the producer and the consumer. This

    The broker components(3): 
        The broker has three components
            1. exchange: receives messages from the producer and send to the consumer
            2. queue: a data structure in disc or memory that store messages 
            3. Binding: The connection between an exchange and a queue.

        Different exchange types:
        1. direct: an exchange of this type sends a message to the queue where the routing key equals the binding key
        2. topic: an excahange of this type sends a message to  the queue where the routing key partial matches the binding key.
                example:
                    i. 'order.*' : sends message to a queue whose routing key starts with 'order'
                    ii. '.*order' : sends message to a queue whose routing key ends with 'order'

        3. fanout: an exchange that sends messages to all queue it is connected to regardles of the binding key or the routing key.
            every queue receives the messages.

        4. Headers: Allows  you to route messages based on header values instead of the routing keys.
        
    note: 
        Rabbitmq has a nameless exchange by default

    code: 
        The session runs rabbitmq in a docker environment
        - docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit rabbitmq:3
        - docker run --rm -it --hostname my-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672  rabbitmq:3-management
